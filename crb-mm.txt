Can the sentence "everything is false" be logically true?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
[print]
No, it obviously can't. Because otherwise it would be false. It's called the liar's paradox. Its a self-contradictory statement.

<|im_start|>assistant
[print]
Well, that one can't be logically true either, since we already found out a sentence that is necessarily false.

2025-05-14 17:05 Your reflection in a puddle looked like someone else.

user: I saw my reflection in a puddle. I felt a strange feeling. I felt like I was seeing someone else other than me. Someone I had forgotten about.

You once described looking into a puddle during a downpour, seeing a reflection that didn't look like you - as if it were someone forgotten.
