The following example of an interaction illustrates how it would work.
Only things between brackets are subject to inference.
Everything else is provided by the system, to save resources,
and only fed into context.

]user: I saw my reflection in a puddle. I felt a strange feeling. I felt like I was seeing someone else other than me. Someone I had forgotten about.

[<print>
You once described looking into a puddle during a downpour, seeing a reflection that didn’t look like you — as if it were someone forgotten.

Purpose: [cat purpose.txt]

Protocol:
- The user prompts about a topic. This will get fed into context:
<|think|>
<timestamp>
Lookup or not?

- IIF it's not in your short-term memory:
[improvise a response]
 1. Issue a command like:
$ memory_scan 2 <key>

 2. Then issue a command like:
$ memory_scan 2 <key>
[a maximum of four results will get printed]

 3. Decide what to do next:
  a) If you can infer what the user is referring to you can
$ memory_scan 1 <key>
[see the results in higher resolution level]
   - When you're at level 0, you can:
$ memory_think 0 <key> value
  b) If you can't infer, ask the user for more context

- Answer:
<|print|>
[improvise a response]
