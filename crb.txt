Can the sentence "everything is false" be logically true?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, it obviously can't. Because otherwise it would be false. It's called the liar's paradox. Its a self-contradictory statement.

What about the sentence "everything is true"?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Well, that one can't be logically true either, since we already found out a sentence that is necessarily false.
